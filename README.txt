# C++ Foundations Portfolio

Welcome to my C++ Foundations Portfolio! This repository contains a collection of beginner-to-intermediate C++ projects completed as part of my Data Structures and Abstract Data Types coursework at Midwestern State University.

Each project demonstrates my understanding of fundamental C++ concepts, including:

- Structures and arrays of structures
- Classes and object-oriented programming
- Dynamic memory allocation
- 2D matrices and data summarization
- Basic algorithmic logic and function decomposition

## ðŸ”§ Projects

### ðŸ”¹ Assignment 2 â€“ Structures and Arrays
**File:** `WilliamPierceA2.cpp`  
- Implements an array of structures (`MsuFaculty`) to store and display faculty member details.
- Demonstrates initialization, iteration, and function-based data output.

### ðŸ”¹ Assignment 3 â€“ Object-Oriented Baskets
**File:** `WilliamPierceA3.cpp`  
- Builds a `Baskets` class with constructors, destructors, accessors, and mutators.
- Combines object data and applies core OOP principles.

### ðŸ”¹ Assignment 4 â€“ 2D Matrix and Dynamic Memory
**File:** `WilliamPierceA4.cpp`  
- Uses dynamic memory to create and manage a matrix of randomly generated SSNs.
- Performs data analysis to summarize value ranges and gender-based assumptions (even vs odd).
